  A data source in Terraform is a way to retrieve information or access existing infrastructure components that are external to your Terraform configuration.
  It allows you to fetch data from various sources such as cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc.), databases, APIs, or any system that Terraform can interact with.
